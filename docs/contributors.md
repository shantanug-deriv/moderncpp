## Discussions

Discussions are concentrated on our GitHub [discussions](https://github.com/alandefreitas/moderncpp/discussions) page.
Don't refrain from asking questions and proposing ideas.

If you are a programmer with good ideas, please [share](https://github.com/alandefreitas/moderncpp/discussions/new)
these ideas with us.

Academic collaboration is more than welcome.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute with new snippets to this repository. For complex features and changes,
consider [getting feedback](https://github.com/alandefreitas/moderncpp/discussions/new) from the community first.

There are many ways in which you can contribute to this library:

* Testing the library in new environments
* Contributing with interesting snippets
* Finding problems in the documentation
* Finding bugs in general
* Whatever idea seems interesting to you

The only thing we ask you is to make sure your contribution is not destructive. Some contributions in which we are not
interested are:

* "I don't like this optional feature so I removed/deprecated it"
* "I removed this feature to support older versions of C++" but have not provided an equivalent alternative. This
  repository is focused on Modern C++.
* "I removed this feature, so I don't have to install/update ______" but have not provided an equivalent alternative
* "I'm creating this high-cost promise that we'll support ________ forever" but I'm not sticking around to keep that
  promise

In doubt, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/alandefreitas/moderncpp/discussions) first.
